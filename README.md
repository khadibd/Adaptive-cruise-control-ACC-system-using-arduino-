Development of an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) System

Project Description:

The Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system is an advanced driver assistance system designed to enhance vehicle safety and comfort by automatically adjusting the vehicle's speed to maintain a safe following distance from the car ahead. This project involves the design, implementation, and testing of an ACC system equipped with a PID controller for dynamic speed regulation.

Key Features:

Dynamic Speed Regulation: The ACC system adjusts the vehicle's speed in real-time based on the distance to the preceding vehicle, ensuring a safe and comfortable driving experience.
PID Controller Integration: The system employs a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to fine-tune the speed adjustments, providing smooth and responsive control.
Ultrasonic Sensor: An ultrasonic sensor is used to accurately measure the distance to the vehicle ahead, feeding real-time data to the PID controller.
Arduino-Based Implementation: The system is developed using Arduino, leveraging its flexibility and ease of integration with various sensors and actuators.
DC Motor Control: DC motors are used to simulate the vehicle's throttle and braking mechanisms, enabling precise control over the vehicle's speed.
Technologies and Tools:

Arduino: For microcontroller-based control and integration with sensors and actuators.
DC Motors: To simulate the vehicle's throttle and braking actions.
Ultrasonic Sensor: For distance measurement and real-time feedback.
PID Controller: For implementing the dynamic speed regulation algorithm.
Objectives:

Enhance Vehicle Safety: By maintaining a safe following distance, the ACC system reduces the risk of rear-end collisions.
Improve Driver Comfort: The system automates speed adjustments, reducing driver fatigue during long drives.
Demonstrate Advanced Control Systems: Showcase the application of PID control in automotive systems.
Outcomes:

Successful implementation and testing of an ACC system that dynamically adjusts speed based on real-time distance measurements.
Demonstrated effectiveness of PID control in achieving smooth and responsive speed regulation.
Enhanced understanding of automotive control systems and sensor integration.
This ACC project highlights the practical application of control theory and sensor technology in the automotive industry, contributing to the development of safer and more efficient vehicles.
